Water Tap is a fun and easy way to track how much water you’re drinking every day.

Every time you’ve had a drink, open the app and just tap the ‘Add Water’ button. We will keep tabs on how much water you’ve had in a feature we call Tracker, which includes an easy-to-read chart and a useful calendar infographic that lets you quickly check on your progress over time.

You can also set up a custom daily intake goal, change the default amount of water consumed each time you tap, or set up daily reminders from inside the app that will prompt you to drink up (you know, in case you forget). And even though the developers live in the US, we know the metric system is better – so we’ve also created the option to track your intake in milliliters instead of ounces.

We also optionally connect with Apple’s HealthKit (requires iOS8 and later) to determine your personal attributes like height and weight. If you give us a little more information, like your climate and expected amount of strenuous activity, we will give you a recommendation of how much water you should aim to drink every day. Disclaimer: we are programmers, not MDs, so please seek out advice from your doctor or healthcare professional if you are looking for a specific water intake goal.

When iOS9 launches, we will also be adding the feature that will save your water intake TO HealthKit.
